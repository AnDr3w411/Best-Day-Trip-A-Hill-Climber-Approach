{"name":"Best Day Trip: A Hill Climber Approach","tagline":"Hill climber algorithm to find the best possible day trip","body":"## Generate the best possible day trip!\r\n\r\nThis project is meant to generate an optimized day trip using the googleAPI to get places and a hill climbing algorithm to find the trip that takes you to the best places with the shortest travel time. This is a type of traveling salesman problem with a hill climber algorithm used to solve it. With the googleAPI I was able to get all of the places within a specified radius of the types that I am interested in, i.e. museums. I am able to query googleAPI to find the travel time between 2 places and each place has a rating attribute based on user reviews. With a rating and a time the algorithm just goes through a pregenerated trip making changes where ever it can to improve the \"happiness\" level of the trip.\r\n\r\nI decided to do this project because I never know what I want to do and I saw an article saying scientists found the perfect road trip so I wanted to make something that could potentially be useful to find something to do for the day.\r\n\r\nYou will need a GoogleAPI key. Instructions on how to get one can be found here https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key \r\nSpecifically Google Maps Distance Matrix API, Google Maps Geocoding API, and Google Places API Web Service are what are used here.\r\nhttps://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python\r\nhttps://github.com/slimkrazy/python-google-places\r\n\r\n\r\n##Original Trip\r\nAverage Rating:  4.26   \r\nTotal Time:  1 hr 3 min and 16 seconds\r\n![original trip](http://oi68.tinypic.com/2qd2z4m.jpg)\r\n##Final Trip\r\nAverage Rating:  4.6   \r\nTotal Time:  54 minutes and 21 seconds\r\n![final trip](http://oi65.tinypic.com/2m6r3ev.jpg)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
